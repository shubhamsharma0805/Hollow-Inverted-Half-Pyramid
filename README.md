# Hollow-Inverted-Half-Pyramid
The Hollow Inverted Half Pyramid is a pattern-based problem where you need to generate a right-angled triangle that is both inverted and hollow. The pattern starts with a full row of asterisks (*) at the top, and as it progresses downward, the number of asterisks decreases while maintaining a hollow structure in the middle.
